Can we reconstruct a (biosynthetic) reaction pathway simply from the structures. 

It turns out the answer is no - but you can get large contiguous parts of the pathway - but there needs to be chemical insight into identifying unrealistic chemical or metabolic transformations.

This model uses some of the structures from the pseudomonic acid pathway see cdx file
